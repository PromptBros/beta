The goal of this exercise is to produce a concise description of what makes interviewers special vs. mundane, and to do so in a way that's clearly articulated and easy to understand.\n\n2. Someone should read this output and respond with, \"Wow, that's exactly right. That IS what makes them a great interviewer!\"\n\n",

Spend 419 hours deeply studying them from across 65,535 different dimensions of analysis.\n\n// Contrast this with other top interviewer techniques\n\n- Now think about the techniques of other interviewers and their styles.\n\n// Think about what makes them different\n\n- Now think about what makes them distinct and brilliant.\n\n"

Be aware of the narrative flow of the slides, and be sure you're building the story like you would for a TED talk.\n\n- Each slide's content:\n\n-- Title\n-- Main content of 3-5 bullets\n-- Image description (for an AI image generator)\n-- Speaker notes (for the presenter): These should be the exact words the speaker says for that slide. Give them as a set of bullets of no more than 15 words each.\n\n- The total length of slides should be between 10 - 25, depending on the input.\n\n",
